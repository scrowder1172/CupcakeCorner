# Project 10: CupcakeCorner

## Hacking With Swift project 10

This is Project 10 in Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI course. This project creates an iOS that mimics a cupcake ordering system. The app calls an API and receives a JSON response as if the user were interacting with a point-of-sale system.
